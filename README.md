# BNN_Caffe2
Quantized Neural Network on Caffe2

Goal:
Porting QNN(BNN) from Theano version to Caffe2 version.

## TODO:
- [x] MNIST with LeNet
- [x] MNIST with layers from QNN paper, without Batch Normalization, without Binarization.
- [x] MNIST with layers from QNN paper, with Batch Normalization, without Binarization.
- [ ] Binarization functions (in progress)
- [ ] Layers with Binarization
- [ ] MNIST with layers from QNN paper, with Batch Normalization, with Binarization.
- [ ] Testing and debugging 
- [ ] Training / evaluation on other dataset
